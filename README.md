excuse-generator
================

This is a very small just for fun javascript project to generate excuses.
It also contains useful code to make any generator
The function `generator` accepts three arrays and gives you a function that can be used to generate a random sentence
consisting of each part of the array. So yeah, it can be useful. Apart from that, check this out at github.com
